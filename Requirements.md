# The Five Steps of Design Analysis: Chunk, Infer, Relate,
Explain, Activate
Design analysis is the process of making sense of research so it can guide design. It helps you
turn raw information—like interview transcripts, observation notes, or secondary sources—into
useful insights and actionable directions.
The process has five fundamental steps:

## 1. Chunk – Break the information down.
Start by dividing your research into small, individual pieces of information called chunks. A
chunk might be a quote, an observation, or a single fact. Think of chunks as building
blocks—each one should contain a single idea and be roughly the same size as the others. Don’t
go too granular; if a chunk can’t be broken down further without losing meaning, it&#39;s at the right
level.

## 2. Infer – Ask what each chunk means.
Once you’ve identified your chunks, interpret them. For each one, ask:
- What does this mean?
- Why is this important?
- What is this telling us about the problem, topic, or context?

You can come up with more than one meaning per chunk. At this stage, it’s okay if meanings
overlap. The goal is not to code them formally, but to make thoughtful, logical interpretations in
your own words.

## 3. Relate – Find patterns across meanings.
Now, look at your inferences and group the ones that feel connected. Which meanings are
pointing in the same direction? Where do you see repetition or shared themes? These patterns
show how pieces of information relate.
Give each pattern a clear, meaningful name. Patterns aren’t just categories—they express
relationships and reveal structure in the data.

## 4. Explain – Dig into why the patterns matter.
Ask “why?” for each pattern.
- Why is this happening?
- Why does it matter?
- What deeper truth does this reveal?

Your answers are insights: powerful, sometimes surprising explanations about people, behavior,
or systems. A strong insight is often:
- Non-consensus – It challenges a common assumption.
- First-principles-based – It reflects a fundamental truth.

Write your insights as short, bold headlines. Try to name them in a way that captures their
uniqueness and significance.

## 5. Activate – Turn insights into design direction.
For every insight, write a design principle: a clear, actionable statement that suggests how
design should respond. These are not final solutions but starting points for ideation.
Design principles often begin with phrases like:
&quot;The system should…&quot; or &quot;The experience must…&quot;
Some helpful verbs: provide, match, reduce, enable, avoid, combine, simplify, clarify, etc.
A good design principle sparks the question:
“How might we do that?”
That question leads you directly into idea generation.

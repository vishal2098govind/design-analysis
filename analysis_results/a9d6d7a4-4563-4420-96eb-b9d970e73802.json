      "explanation": "The issues encountered during the handoff from design to development, especially the lack of technical context, reveal a critical gap in the design-development workflow. This gap is not merely a procedural oversight; it represents a fundamental disconnect between how designers envision products and how developers build them. Providing technical context at the handoff stage is essential for bridging this divide, enabling developers to understand not just what to build, but why. This insight challenges the common focus on documentation and tools, arguing that the integration of technical context into handoff processes is key to seamless execution and innovation.",
